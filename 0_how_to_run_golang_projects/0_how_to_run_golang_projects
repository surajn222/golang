1. Install golang on your local system
2. Check the version of Golang by running: go version
3. There are two types of Go Projects: Executable and Non-executable. We will talk about executable projects only
4. Whenever you clone a project from github, there are two ways of running it
    a. When you see a go.mod file already present in it
        Eg.
            https://github.com/surajn222/go-http-monitor
            https://github.com/surajn222/ran: ran.go is the file
            https://github.com/surajn222/go-postgres
            https://github.com/surajn222/go-sqldb

    We will talk about the first one only
        To run: go run main.go
        To build: go build main.go

    Lets try it in all of the above projects.

    b. when you don't see a go.mod already present in it
        Eg.
            https://github.com/surajn222/go-monitor
            https://github.com/surajn222/gowebapp
            https://github.com/surajn222/simple-go-server
            
        Its better to convert them to go modules:
